**About** <br/>

Travend is an application that provides users with nearby restaurants information and allows them to get
interact with each other by commenting on the restaurants. Users have to sign up first in order to use the
app. After they give the required information they are now able to use Travendâ€™s features such as uploading

  (We used a specific url because google maps API did not function correctly even
  though we gave the latitude and longitude information provided by geoLocator
  So we had to give this URL with hardcoded query. But we wanted to make it
  clear for you that we have tried the dynamic version which uses the latitude
  and longitude values. Therefore, you will see restaurants in given query in the link)
8. Click the markers to go to the restaurant's page.
